# Layoffs Database Cleaning and Analysis
In this project, I cleaned and explored a Layoffs database to practice identifying meaningful, data-driven insights from real-world datasets.

## Overview
The database cleaning file shows the process used to clean the database to prepare it for exploratory analysis. The exploratory analysis file shows insights such as which year had the highest number of layoffs, the rolling total of layoffs by month, and more. 

## Tools & Technologies
- MySQL / SQL


## Data Cleaning Process
1. Remove duplicate data
2. Standardized formats
3. Remove or fill in Null/blank values
4. Remove any unnecessary rows/columns

## Key Tools
-   Creating CTEs
-   Joins
-   Updating/Altering Tables
-   Using row numbers
-   Using Window Functions
